# AUTONOMOUS_WORKLOG

Codex 또는 작업 에이전트가 라운드마다 갱신하는 작업 로그다.

## Current baseline

Repository: `MS0502/eve-project`

ChatGPT generated local package:

- `eve_v3_round96_runtime_mapping_enable_smoke_precheck.zip`

Known completed rounds:

- Round95: runtime mapping operator acceptance fixture
- Round96: runtime mapping enable-smoke precheck

## Round95 summary

Goal:

- Convert Round94 enforcement dry-run into an operator acceptance fixture.

Changed areas in generated package:

- `adapters/lex_concept_mapping_adapter.py`
- `adapters/runtime_smoke_runner.py`
- `adapters/state_debug_adapter.py`
- `tests/test_v3_round95_runtime_mapping_operator_acceptance_fixture.py`

Result:

- Accepted token: `민석`
- Blocked token: `EVE`
- Runtime mapping remained disabled.
- Enforcement remained disabled.

## Round96 summary

Goal:

- Add a read-only pre-mutation checklist for future runtime mapping enable smoke.

Changed areas in generated package:

- `adapters/lex_concept_mapping_adapter.py`
- `adapters/runtime_smoke_runner.py`
- `adapters/state_debug_adapter.py`
- `tests/test_v3_round96_runtime_mapping_enable_smoke_precheck.py`

Validation in ChatGPT runtime:

- compileall passed
- Round94~Round96 focused/adjacent tests: 7 passed
- collect-only: 1217 tests collected
- full pytest was attempted but not completed because the chat runtime interrupted after 60 seconds

Result:

- Ready token for future separate enable smoke: `민석`
- Runtime mapping remained disabled.
- Enforcement remained disabled.

## Round97 — controlled runtime mapping enable smoke

Goal:

- Enable runtime lexical→concept mapping only inside a controlled smoke path for the Round96-ready token `민석`.

Changed files:

- `adapters/lex_concept_mapping_adapter.py`
- `adapters/runtime_smoke_runner.py`
- `adapters/state_debug_adapter.py`
- `main.py`
- `tests/test_v3_round97_98_runtime_mapping_enable_smoke.py`

Commands run:

- `python eve_v3_autonomous_handoff/packages/restore_round96_package.py`
- `pytest -q tests/test_v3_round97_98_runtime_mapping_enable_smoke.py`
- `pytest -q tests/test_v3_round92_runtime_mapping_gate_dry_run.py tests/test_v3_round93_runtime_mapping_proposal_report.py tests/test_v3_round94_runtime_mapping_enforcement_dry_run.py tests/test_v3_round95_runtime_mapping_operator_acceptance_fixture.py tests/test_v3_round96_runtime_mapping_enable_smoke_precheck.py tests/test_v3_round97_98_runtime_mapping_enable_smoke.py && python -m compileall -q adapters tests main.py`

Results:

- `민석` mapped ephemerally during the smoke.
- Runtime mapping rolled back to disabled.
- Enforcement remained disabled.
- No new AGP/vector/category/memory mutation occurred during the smoke.

Failures / limitations:

- Medium 30k vectors are absent, so full medium validation is blocked/partial.
- Legacy root collect-only and full compileall remain partial for pre-existing issues documented in validation JSON.

Next recommendation:

- Round98 persistence gate audit.

## Round98 — runtime mapping persistence gate audit

Goal:

- Audit Round97 rollback and decide whether a persistence decision is ready for operator review.

Results:

- Hard stop: false.
- Gate status: ready for operator persistence decision.
- Runtime mapping remains disabled by default.
- Persistence is not applied and still requires operator approval plus full/medium validation.
